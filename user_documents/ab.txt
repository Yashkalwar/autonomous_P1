Hello,

Confession: this isn’t going to be the usual cover letter full of keywords. Instead, let me explain why JPMorgan’s Applied AI/ML Associate role feels like the natural progression of my journey.

I began my career in enterprise software at Amdocs, where precision wasn’t optional, it was the baseline. Migrating legacy systems, refining billing pipelines, and ensuring real-time accuracy taught me the discipline of building software that businesses can trust. That discipline carried forward when I transitioned into AI, pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at King’s College London. There, I immersed myself in the science of multi-agent systems, reasoning, computer vision, and AI ethics, while also competing in (and winning) hackathons where I built agentic architectures from scratch.

Today, as an AI Solutions Engineer at Cogniwide UK, I design and deploy end-to-end AI systems: evaluating state-of-the-art frameworks, architecting scalable pipelines, and coding production-ready solutions. My work has spanned RAG pipelines, memory-augmented agents, and applied LLMs, experiences directly aligned with JPMorgan’s mission to revolutionize how the Private Bank services its clients.

What excites me most about this role is the focus on autonomous AI agents and GenAI solutions in a domain where trust, accuracy, and resilience are non-negotiable. Financial systems operate under the same constraints I’ve faced in telecom and enterprise AI: latency must be low, predictions must be reliable, and decisions must be explainable. The chance to bring my background in applied AI, agentic architectures, and cloud-ready deployment (AWS, Lambda, S3, Glue) into the world of private banking feels like a challenge worth pursuing.

I may not consider myself extraordinary, but I adapt fast, experiment relentlessly, and thrive in collaborative environments where curiosity drives solutions. What I bring is not just proficiency in Python, SQL, PyTorch, and HuggingFace, but the ability to turn research into resilient, production-grade systems that create real business value.

I’d welcome the opportunity to connect and explore how I can contribute to JPMorgan’s vision of transforming private banking through AI.

Warm regards,
Yash Kalwar
